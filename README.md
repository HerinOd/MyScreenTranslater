Couldn't find any suitable screen translator software out there, so I tried to make one for 
my own personal use (it's crappy, but gets the job done). It only translates English to Vietnamese currently using Gemini.

// Welp, I didn't know you must not let your API Key exposed, which I just did, (dumb) I'll find a solution later when I have
// time, the translator won't work for now. Bye!! 😀
